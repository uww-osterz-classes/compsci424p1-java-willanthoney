        //    and 15.

        // 2. While the user has not typed "end", continue accepting
        //    commands. Add each command to a list of actions to take 
        //    while you run the simulation.
        // 3. When the user types "end" (or optionally any word that 
        //    is not "create" or "destroy"), stop accepting commands 
        //    and complete the following steps.
        //
        // Hint: Steps 2 and 3 refer to the same loop. ;-)

        // 4. Create an object of the Version 1 class and an object of
        //    the Version 2 class.

        // 5. Run the command sequence once with the Version 1 object, 
        //    calling its showProcessTree method after each command to
        //    show the changes in the tree after each command.

        // 6. Repeat step 5, but with the Version 2 object.

        // 7. Store the current system time in a variable

        // ... then run the command sequence 200 times with Version 1.

        // ... After this, store the new current system time in a
        //     second variable. Subtract the start time from the end 
        //     time to get the Version 1 running time, then display 
        //     the Version 1 running time.

        // 8. Repeat step 7, but with the Version 2 object.
